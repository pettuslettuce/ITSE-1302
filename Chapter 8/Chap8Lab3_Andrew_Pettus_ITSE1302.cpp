/*Write a program that allows the user to enter the last names of five candidates in a local election and the number of votes received by each candidate. 
The program should then output each candidateâ€™s name, the number of votes received, and the percentage of the total votes received by the candidate. 
Your program should also output the winner of the election. 

A sample output is:

Candidate                       Votes Received          % of Total Vote

Faye Kitt-Knightley                 5000                    25.91
Benedict Buttryingtobenicer         4000                    20.73
Arthur Anymoredonuts                6000                    31.09
Oswald Thatendswald                 2500                    12.95
Lars Lars Pantsonfars               1800                     9.33
